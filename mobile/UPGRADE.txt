This document describes how to update your mobile application from one minor
version of DrupalGap to another. For example, 7.x-1.2-alpha to 7.x-1.3-alpha

7.x-1.2-alpha => 7.x-1.3-alpha

  Any themes created prior to 7.x-1.3-alpha need to have their template_info()
  hook updated to match the new region naming convention. The regions are now
  keyed by name and will have their 'name' property automatically set. We made
  this change so regions could easily be accessed
  (e.g. drupalgap.theme.regions.header) instead of having to iterate over all
  regions looking for a specific name. See themes/easystreet3/easystreet3.js
  for example code.
  
  hook_device_online() has been renamed to hook_deviceready()
