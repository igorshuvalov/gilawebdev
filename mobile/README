0. Enable the DrupalGap Module on your Drupal Site

1. Complete the PhoneGap Getting Started Guide for your Platform

   http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.7.0/guide_getting-started_index.md.html#Getting%20Started%20Guides

2. Download the latest stable release of DrupalGap:

   https://github.com/signalpoint/DrupalGap/tags

3. Extract the downloaded DrupalGap archive into PhoneGap's www
   directory. When you are done, the drupalgap.js file will be
   located here:

   www/drupalgap.js

   Note, the DrupalGap index.html will overwrite the index.html provided
   by PhoneGap.

4. Open www/app/default.settings.js and save a copy of it as settings.js
   so the copy of it lives here: 
   
   www/app/settings.js
   
5. Specify your Drupal site path (with NO trailing slash) in settings.js,
   for example:

   'site_path':'http://www.drupalgap.org',

6. Run your new Mobile Application!

===================================

From here you'll have a great start to building a mobile application that
integrates with your Drupal website.
